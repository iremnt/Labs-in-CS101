# Labs-in-CS101 </br></br>

Warnings!!! </br>
-Currently not all the labs have revision parts. I'll add them. </br>
-This repository will be finished after i add all revisions but in reality we finished all labs. </br>
-All labs have restrictions and obligations. Eg. we weren't allowed to use data structures or oop if the lab instructions didnt allowed clearly. </br>
-At some point one can easily say that "But not using this features make the code complicated and long." yeah, this is totally true! </br>
