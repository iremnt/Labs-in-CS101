# Labs-in-CS101 </br></br>

Warnings!!! </br>
-This repository is completed. </br>
-All labs have restrictions and obligations. For example, we weren't allowed to use data structures or OOP unless the lab instructions clearly allowed it. </br>
-At some point, one can easily say that "But not using these features makes the code complicated and long." yeah, this is totally true! </br>
